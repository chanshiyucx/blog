## Self Introduction

> Tell me a bit about yourself and your professional journey so far.  

I'm Xin Chen, a Full-Stack Developer from China, now based in Munich with an Opportunity Card work permit.

I have over 8 years of experience in web development, mainly focusing on the frontend with technologies like React, Vue.js, and TypeScript. Over the years, I have grown from junior to senior roles, building scalable and high-performance web applications.

I also have hands-on experience with Spring Boot on the backend, so I can collaborate smoothly with backend teams.

I've completed intensive German courses and reached B1 level. I'm motivated to join a German company where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue growing as a web developer.

I look forward to talking about how I can support your team.

## Reasons for Coming to Germany

> Why did you decide to come to Germany for work?  
> What motivated you to seek opportunities in Germany specifically?  
> What attracts you about working in the German tech industry?  
> How do you see your career developing in Germany?

Well, there are a couple of main reasons.

On the personal side, my girlfriend is doing her PhD at LMU in Munich and has been here for four years. So I moved here to be with her and start our life together.

Professionally, I've always been interested in the German tech scene. Munich is one of Europe's major IT hubs with a highly developed IT industry. This gives me much better opportunities to find the right position that matches my skills and experience. I really like the work culture of German companies, as they focus on quality and value work-life balance, which is important to me too.

I'm also excited about working with international teams and contributing to innovative projects. I'm ready to bring my web development background to this market and take on new challenges.

## Reason for Application

> Why are you interested in this position?  
> What attracts you to this Frontend Developer position?  
> What made you apply to our company?  
> Why do you want to work for our company?  
> How do you see yourself fitting into our team?

That's a great question. This role at Sungrow really appeals to me for a few key reasons.

First, I'm genuinely excited about Sungrow's mission - 'Clean Power for All'. I've been looking for opportunities where my tech skills can make a real positive impact, and renewable energy is a field I'm passionate about.

Second, the role is a perfect match for my experience. The role involves front-end architecture design, performance optimization, and working with technologies like Vue.js and TypeScript. In my most recent role, I led the technical architecture for a storage management platform using exactly those technologies. With my 8 years of web development experience, I'm confident I can handle the technical challenges.

So, the combination of meaningful work and perfect technical fit makes this role really suitable to me.

## Impressions of Munich

I really love Munich! It's been a great experience living here so far.

The city has such a nice balance. The public transport system is really convenient, so I can easily get anywhere I need to go.

I also like how international Munich is. There is a good mix of locals and internationals here. It makes it easier for me to settle in. At the same time, I'm trying to improve my German and connect more with the local culture.

Overall, Munich feels like a great place for both my career and personal life. I can definitely see myself staying here long-term.

## Work Experience

### Question

- Can you walk me through your previous work experience?
- What kind of projects did you mainly work on in your last role?
- Which achievements or responsibilities are you most proud of in your past jobs?
- What were your key contributions as a Senior Frontend Developer at Toyou Feiji Electronics?  

### Answer

I worked as a Senior Frontend Developer with full-stack responsibilities at Toyou Feiji Electronics last two year. My main project was the redesign of a storage management platform. I led the frontend architecture with Vue.js and TypeScript, migrated the build system to Vite, which improved build times by over 60%, and introduced ESLint standards that resolved more than 300 code issues. I also designed an AI chat tool integrated with Ragflow to support customer service.

Before that, at Blitz Interactive, I built a proprietary instant messaging system with a Spring Boot backend and a chat interface with media support. I also containerized the system with Docker for scalability.

And earlier in my career at Jinji Network Technology, I focused on React Native and React projects, such as building a cross-platform mobile app and an admin frontend with file upload and data visualization.

Overall, my projects gave me strong experience in building scalable frontend systems, improving performance, and collaborating across full-stack teams.

## Clean Code Standards

### Question

- Can you give an example of how you've applied these standards in a past project?

### Answer

Sure. For example, in a management dashboard project, I worked on a file upload page where users often needed to upload very large files.

To improve performance and user experience, I optimized the upload component by implementing file chunking and batch uploading. This way, the files were uploaded in smaller parts simultaneously, which significantly reduced the waiting time.

At the same time, I kept the code modular and easy to maintain, so other developers could quickly understand and extend the component if needed. As a result, the upload process became much faster and smoother, and the feedback from both the team and users was very positive.

## Vue or React

### Question

- Since your resume highlights strong experience with both React and Vue.js, could you share an example of when you chose one framework over the other for a specific project, and what factors influenced your decision?

### Answer

Thank you—I'm glad you found them impressive! For instance, in my role at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I chose Vue.js for the storage management platform redesign because of its lightweight nature and excellent reactivity system, which suited our need for rapid prototyping and seamless state management in a complex UI. In contrast, at Jinji Network Technology, I opted for React when building the admin frontend and React Native app, as it offered better ecosystem support for mobile cross-platform development and integrated well with libraries like Ant Design for data visualization. The decision often boils down to project scale, team familiarity, and performance requirements.

## Backend Experience

### Question

- Could you tell me about your backend experience, particularly with Spring Boot? What kind of backend systems have you built or worked with?

### Answer

While my primary expertise is frontend development, I do have hands-on backend experience, particularly with Spring Boot.

At Blitz Interactive Entertainment, I built a complete messaging system using Spring Boot. This involved developing RESTful APIs, implementing real-time communication features, and creating an analytics dashboard. I handled everything from database design with MySQL to deployment using Docker.

More recently at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I joined the backend team to refactor APIs. During this project, I used Python and Django to build Redfish-compliant APIs for storage device management, and I successfully refactored over 100 interfaces.

## Problem-Solving and Technical Challenges

### Question

- Can you walk me through a particularly challenging technical problem you encountered in one of your projects? How did you approach solving it, and what was the outcome?

### Answer

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, our storage management platform had a critical performance issue. Our project is based on vue2, as the codebase grew, the Webpack build process was taking over 10 minutes, which was severely impacting our team's productivity.

My task was to find a solution that would significantly improve build performance without disrupting our existing codebase or introducing bugs.

I researched various approaches and proposed migrating from Webpack to Vite. However, this was complex because we were using Vue 2, and Vite primarily supports Vue 3. I had to carefully plan the migration, configure compatibility plugins, update our build configuration, and coordinate extensive testing with our QA team to ensure stability.

The result was impressive - we reduced build times from 9 minutes to under 3 minutes, a 60% improvement. More importantly, this taught me the value of thorough planning when upgrading core infrastructure and the importance of close collaboration with testing teams.

## English Level

> How would you describe your English skills?  
> Are you comfortable working in English on a daily basis?

I'm fluent in professional English and use it every day at work. I can handle technical discussions, documentation, and meetings in English, so I feel very confident using it.

## German Level

### Question

- Are you learning German?
- What is your current level of German?
- Do you plan to improve your German skills while working here?

### Answer

Yes, I'm actively learning German. I've completed intensive courses up to B1 level and I'm continuing to improve. I want to keep improving my German to communicate more naturally with colleagues and clients.

## Available Date

> When would you be available to start?  
> What is your earliest possible starting date?

I am available to start immediately.

## Visa

> Do you already have a valid work permit for Germany?  
> Would you need sponsorship?  
> What is your current visa status?

I already have an Opportunity Card work permit, so I'm authorized to work in Germany without requiring sponsorship.

> How long is your Opportunity Card valid for?

It's valid until November 2025.

## Salary

> What are your salary expectations?  
> What salary do you envision?  
> Do you have a salary range in mind?  

Based on my experience and my research of the Munich market, my salary expectation is in the €60k to €70k range. But I'm open to discussion depending on the overall package, including benefits, growth opportunities, and the specific responsibilities of the role.

> Is this range based on your current salary, or on market research?

It's mainly based on my research of the Munich market and my 8 years of experience in web development.

> If we offered €55k, would you consider it?

€55k is a bit below my target range, but I'd be open to discussing it if the role offers strong growth opportunities and is a great fit for my skills.

> What's the minimum salary you would accept?

Based on the market in Munich and my background, I believe €60 is a fair salary.

> What is your current salary?

I prefer to focus on the market value of the role here in Munich and the skills I bring, rather than my current salary. My expectation is based on my experience and the Munich market, not directly on my current salary.
