When I added the Musing Page to my blog, I was looking forward to using it as a way to improve my English. Honestly, my English is pretty terrible — especially speaking. I can barely get a sentence out when talking to people, and without AI, I can't write anything on my own.

I've always been frustrated by this, even though I've put a lot of time and effort into trying to get better. Nothing really seemed to work. This time, I'm trying something different: writing short daily musings. I hope I can keep it up.
