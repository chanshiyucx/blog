It's been a long time since I last studied German. After my German course ended in July last year, I haven't touched it since. There are a few reasons for that. The main one is that I just lost motivation. I originally started learning German to find a job, but I figured it would be really hard to land a job through German, and that English would be the easier route.

In the end, it turned out just like I thought. I found my job through English, not German. Will I keep learning German someday? Honestly, I have no idea.
