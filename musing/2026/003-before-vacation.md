Chinese New Year is next week. Most of my colleagues have already gone back home—there's only three of us left in the office now. It's pretty quiet around here.

This will be my third year in Munich instead of going home. I'm planning to go to Barcelona this year, but I haven't booked my flight or put in for time off yet. Honestly though, I can't focus on work at all right now. I can't wait.
